# A set of manual system tests in pseudo-gherkin notation

Background: 
    Given the insight version is 5 unless otherwise stated
    And the user is logged in as admin unless otherwise stated
    And the user has uploaded a new instance of the provided "Dashboards" example
        
Feature: Static dashboard
    Scenario: the dashboard shows stats on the scenarios owned by admin
        Given the user is in the app
        And the user is on the first dashboard view
        When the user creates 3 additional scenarios
        And the user adds all 4 scenarios to the shelf
        And the user loads all of the scenariso
        And the user runs all of the scenarios.
        Then the dashboard shows total scenarios=4
        And the score scalar chart has 4 bars
        And the status swimlanes show 4 statuses
        And the app attachment table is empty.
    
    Scenario: the system folder and user scenario are created as expected
        Given the user has performed the previous tests
        When the user opens the scenario manager
        Then there is a root folder called _system
        And the _system folder is owned by admin
        And the _system folder is shared full access
        When the user navigates into the _system folder
        Then they see a scenario called "dashboard1.admin" owned by admin and private
    
    Scenario: the dashboarding is resilient to the system folder being deleted
        Given the user has performed the previous tests
        When the user opens the scenario manager
        And deletes the folder called _system
        And clicks on the refresh button
        Then the dashboard with previous state is shown
        When the user opens the scenario manager
        And deletes the folder called _system
        And navigates away from the first dashboard view
        And navigates back to the first dashboard view
        Then the dashboard with previous state is shown
    
    Scenario: the dashboard state is deterministic
        Given the user has performed the previous tests
        When the user clicks the refresh button
        Then a spinner and message "Generating dashboard.. please wait" is shown
        When a short time has passed
        Then the spinner and message are removed
        And the dashboard is visible
        And the stats are unchanged
    
    Scenario: the dashboard updates to the latest state on refresh
        Given the user has performed the previous tests
        When the user creates, loads and runs a 5th scenario
        And the user clicks the refresh button
        Then the dashboard updates
        And the dashboard shows stats for 5 scenarios
    
    Scenario: the dashboard updates to the latest state on navigation
        Given the user has performed the previous tests
        When the user creates, loads and runs a 6th scenario
        And the user navigates away from the view
        And the user navigates back to the view
        Then the dashboard updates
        And the dashboard shows stats for 6 scenarios
    
Feature: Dashboards are per user
    Scenario: a second user does not see the same stats as the admin user
        Given the user logs in with a different account called user2
        And the user is on the first dashboard view
        Then the user sees stats reflecting zero scenarios
        When the user creates 2 scenarios
        And the user adds the 2 scenarios to the shelf
        And the user loads the 2 scenariso
        And the user runs the 2 scenarios.
        Then the dashboard shows total scenarios=2
        When the user logs out
        And the user logs in as the admin user
        And the user goes to the first dashboard view
        Then the dashboard stats show stats for 6 scenarios
        
    
    Scenario: each user has their own dashboard scenario    
        Given the second user has performed the previous tests
        When the second user opens the scenario manager
        When the second user navigates into the _system folder
        Then they see a scenario called "dashboard1.user2" owned by user2 and private
    
Feature: automatic checking for when the dashboard is out of date
    Scenario: a scenario is removed which invalidates the dashboard state
        Given the user is logged in as admin
        And the user is viewing the second dashboard view
        And the user deletes one of the scenarios owned by admin
        When at most a few seconds time has passed
        Then a info message is displayed at the top of the dashboard
        And the info message says the dashboard may be out of date
    
    Scenario: refreshing the dashboard makes it current again
        Given the second user has performed the previous test
        And the second dashboard is showing the info message
        When the user clicks on refresh
        And the dashboard is updated
        Then the info message is removed
